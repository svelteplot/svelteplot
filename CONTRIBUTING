Here are a few things you can help with:

- If you find a bug in SveltePlot, please first create a reproducing example in the [Svelte Playground](https://svelte.dev/playground/) and open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/svelteplot/svelteplot/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
- If you spot a mistake in the documentation, you can fix it directly in Github (a PR will be created)
- Feel free to suggest new features by opening a [feature request issue](https://github.com/svelteplot/svelteplot/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) on Github.
- Still unsure how you can help? Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pp2wRJqtHV) and say Hi!

## Development Setup

### Pre-commit hooks (recommended)

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting
checks before each commit. To set it up:

1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit` (or `brew install pre-commit` on macOS)
2. Install the hooks: `pre-commit install`

That's it — linting will run automatically on each commit. To run manually:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
