Trail marks are similar to line marks, but can have variable widths determined by backing data. They are useful for visualizing paths or trajectories where the width of the path conveys additional information, such as intensity or volume.

## Options

The trail mark supports the following **scaled channels**

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the trail.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the trail.
- **r**: The radius (width) of the trail at each point.
- **fill**: The fill color of the trail.
